# PDL #

### PHP Dynamic Layouts ###

_A set of PHP classes for dynamically creating HTML layouts using a set of SQLite tables_

Then **./php** directory contains all the classes for this plugin, you can place these into your app directory and include the **pdl.php** file in your application to link to all the classes. All code is commented to explain how it works. The index.php file in the root directory demonstrates a simple implementation. Star if you clone. Fork if you want. Contact if you would ike to contribute.

The **./dba** directory contains [**phpLiteAdmin**](https://code.google.com/p/phpliteadmin/), a tool for managing SQLite databases. The password is 'admin'.

Layouts have been created for use with [**Twitter Bootstrap**](http://getbootstrap.com), a popular front-end framework. These files are in the **./css**, **./fonts**, and **./js** directories.
